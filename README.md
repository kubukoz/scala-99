# scala-99

Here you'll find my solutions for the "99 Scala problems" challenge, hopefully on a regular basis.
Most likely I'll solve them when I don't have other stuff to do, though.

The challenges may be slightly modified to make everything
as pure as possible, e.g. returning an `Option` instead of throwing an exception.

Starting July 18, 2016.
